- **Spring Boot 3**: Backend framework for implementing REST APIs
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing comment data
- **Spring Data MongoDB**: For database interaction
- **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorization
- **Kafka**: For event-driven communication with other services

## üöÄ How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java 21
- Maven
- MongoDB
- Kafka (optional, for event processing)

### Local Development
1. Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible with credentials in `application.yaml`
2. Run the service:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Using Docker
1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t comment-service .
```

2. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 8084:8084 \
  -e SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:root@host.docker.internal:27017/comment-service?authSource=admin \
  -e APP_SERVICES_PROFILE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8081/profile \
  comment-service
```

### Using Docker Compose
The service can be run as part of the entire application stack:
```bash
# From the root directory
docker-compose up comment-service
```

For the entire stack:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

## üîÑ Integration with Other Services

- **Identity Service**: User authentication and authorization
- **Profile Service**: User information for comments
